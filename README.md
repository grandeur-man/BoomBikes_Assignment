## General Information
- What is the background of your project?
 - A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
 - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
 - How well those variables describe the bike demands
- What is the dataset that is being used?
 - The data set use can be found in the root folder in a file called day.csv

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Conclusions
- The following variables were determined to be the most significant variable for determinig the rentals of bikes at BoomBike
 - Temperature
 - Weather condition (Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds)
 - Year
 - Windspeed
 - Season(Winter & Summer)
 - Holiday
 
- The model uses these above variables to explain 79% of the rentals of bikes at Boombikes
